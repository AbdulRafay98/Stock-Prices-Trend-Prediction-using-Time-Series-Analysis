# Stock-Prices-Trend-Prediction-using-Time-Series-Analysis

Using 1 year of price data for two stocks(Twitter and Snapchat) I done the following phases:

1. Determined if there is any correlation between the the two stocks using different correlation algorithms.
2. Created statistical descriptive analysis and inferential analysis of the daily stock price (for both Social Meida Platforms) and plotted the relevant diagrams.

In the First Phase (Finding Correlation between the two Stocks):
* Computed Pearson Correlation Coeffecient.
* Plotted Confusion Matrix

In the Second Phase (Statistical Descriptive & Inferential Analysis):
I apply below mentioned steps on both dataset individually (SnapChat and Twitter) 
* Descriptive Analysis
* Inferential Analysis
* Linear Regression Modeling
* Accessing Model Quality
* Hypothesis Testing
